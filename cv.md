#### **About me**
_My main goal is to develop and improve my technical and soft skills. I am motivated by the opportunity to learn new technologies and solve complex problems. I believe that learning is a lifelong process it is an opportunity to gain new knowledge and improve the knowledge already acquired. Enthusiasm and desire to develop, learning something new, implementing real projects, working with more experienced colleagues are also important all this gives me the opportunity to make everyone better, I strive to learn from every situation. I understand that being a junior developer means not only relying on the team to guide me, but also actively looking for solutions to problems, expanding my knowledge base and gaining more and more skills and applying them in new contexts._
